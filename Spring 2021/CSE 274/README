This folder contains the material for my CSE 274 course at Miami University. The course is formally known as Data Structures and is part of the Computer Science and Software Engineering curriculum. Most of this class dealt with creating data structures that already exist in Java's API, but are written with a specific purpose in mind.

This work was graded and done for class, no one may use this work as their own for any other course, but may look at it for inspiration or use of their own.
